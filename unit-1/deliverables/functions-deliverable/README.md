### Pre-requisites:*

- Differentiate between data types (strings, numbers, Booleans).
- Use if/else if/else conditionals to control program flow based on Boolean conditions.
- Create and manipulate arrays.
- Use loops to iterate through the elements in an array.
- Describe why functions are useful.
- Describe how parameters relate to functions.
- Explain how return statements are used in JavaScript.


## Introduction

Let's practice writing some functions! 

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Follow the requirements in the list below:

1. Define a function `maxOfTwoNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in JavaScript. Do some Googling to figure this out if you forget how conditionals work.
2. Define a function `maxOfThree` that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
3. Write a function `isCharacterAVowel` that takes a character (i.e., a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel and false otherwise.
4. Define a function `sumArray` and a function `multiplyArray` that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, `sumArray([1,2,3,4])` should return 10, and `multiplyArray([1,2,3,4])` should return 24.
5. Write a function that returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.
6. Define a function `reverseString` that reverses a string. For example, reverseString("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".
7. Write a function `findLongestWord` that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest word in the array.
8. Write a function `filterLongWords` that takes an array of words and a number `i` and returns a new array of words that are longer than `i` characters long.


**Bonus**
For this bonus, you'll have to do some research on objects.

1. Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns an object where:

  - The keys are the characters that occur in the string.
  - The values are the number of occurrences for each letter, regardless of the case.

For example, calling the function with the string "General Assembly" will return:

```javascript
{
  a: 2,
  b: 1,
  e: 3,
  g: 1,
  l: 2,
  m: 1,
  n: 1,
  r: 1,
  s: 2,
  y: 1
}
```

#### Starter Code

Open the file `main.js`. All the function names are already inside the file; you just need to implement the functions by adding code inside each one.

##### OPTION 1:
Copy/paste contents of `main.js` into replit and work through the problems there.

##### Option 2:
Use the Chrome Dev Tools console to practice executing your code.

##### Option 3:
Alternately, you can add `console.log();` statements in your `main.js` file; then you should see the values displayed in the console when you open the `index.html` file in your browser.
